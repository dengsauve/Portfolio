1. Mobile looks meh
2. Menus are not z-indexed right on desktop
3. Page is **very** static.
	No CSS response on hovers
4. So dark. So, so dark.
5. Misaligned Edges. For the love of god, why?
6. Site is too big on laptop, no reason that information can't all show on laptop and larger

Plan of Attack:
1. As always, Mobile First
