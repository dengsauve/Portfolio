1. Mobile looks meh
2. Menus are not z-indexed right on desktop
3. Page is **very** static.
	No CSS response on hovers
4. So dark. So, so dark.
5. Misaligned Edges. For the love of god, why?
6. Site is too big on laptop, no reason that information can't all show on laptop and larger
7. One of the fade images has square corners, the rest are rounded! wft, who's managing this site?

Plan of Attack:
1. As always, Mobile First
2. mobile/tablet will be roughly the same. Going for an 'app' feel on mobile
3. laptop/desktop, no difference. Going Lighter while maintaining green color
